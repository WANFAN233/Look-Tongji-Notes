This is an agent skill + CLI for Tongji Look (`look.tongji.edu.cn`):
- login via Tongji IAM SSO (Playwright),
- list courses (recent list or full search),
- transcribe a lecture to `SRT` + `TXT`,
- download lecture slide snapshots (filename includes snapshot time),
- optionally pack slides into one PDF (with optional scan enhancement),
- then let the current agent write a Markdown study note from transcript + slide images.

## Install

### Method 1

Copy the repo link to your agent and say: `help me install this skill`.

### Method 2

Copy the whole `look-tongji-notes/` folder into your skills directory:
- Codex: `~/.codex/skills/look-tongji-notes`
- Claude Code: `~/.claude/skills/look-tongji-notes`

### Method 3 (Codex)

Open Codex and run:

```text
$skill-installer install https://github.com/walkerkiller/look-tongji-notes
```

### Method 4 (Claude Code)

Open Claude Code and run:

```text
/plugin marketplace add https://github.com/walkerkiller/look-tongji-notes
/plugin install look-tongji-notes
```

## Usage (CLI)

`<SKILL_DIR>` is the folder that contains `SKILL.md`.

Setup credentials (recommended):

```bash
python "<SKILL_DIR>/scripts/look_tongji.py" setup
```

List recent courses:

```bash
python "<SKILL_DIR>/scripts/look_tongji.py" list
```

Search courses by name (recommended for accuracy, calls `get_all_courses` internally):

```bash
python "<SKILL_DIR>/scripts/look_tongji.py" list --all --query "<COURSE_NAME_KEYWORD>"
```

Transcript only (`transcribe`, aliases `transcript` / `trans`):

```bash
python "<SKILL_DIR>/scripts/look_tongji.py" transcribe --lecture-url "<LECTURE_URL>"
```

Combined mode (`note`, runs transcript + slide in parallel by default):

```bash
python "<SKILL_DIR>/scripts/look_tongji.py" note --lecture-url "<LECTURE_URL>"
```

Download slide snapshots for a lecture:

```bash
python "<SKILL_DIR>/scripts/look_tongji.py" slide --lecture-url "<LECTURE_URL>"
```

Download slides and export to one PDF:

```bash
python "<SKILL_DIR>/scripts/look_tongji.py" slide --lecture-url "<LECTURE_URL>" --to-pdf
```

Export PDF with document-scan style enhancement (CamScanner-like):

```bash
python "<SKILL_DIR>/scripts/look_tongji.py" slide --lecture-url "<LECTURE_URL>" --to-pdf --scan-mode doc
```

Strong black-white scan effect:

```bash
python "<SKILL_DIR>/scripts/look_tongji.py" slide --lecture-url "<LECTURE_URL>" --to-pdf --scan-mode bw
```

Parse selected PDF pages with MinerU OpenAPI and save Markdown:

```bash
python "<SKILL_DIR>/scripts/look_tongji.py" slide --lecture-url "<LECTURE_URL>" --to-pdf --mineru --mineru-pages "17-24"
```

`--mineru` currently uses MinerU OpenAPI flash extraction through `mineru-open-sdk`.
It saves Markdown only under `./tongji-output/slide-pdf/mineru_<course_id>_<sub_id>/`.
No local MinerU model download is required.

If throttling is suspected, reduce concurrency:

```bash
python "<SKILL_DIR>/scripts/look_tongji.py" slide --course-id "<COURSE_ID>" --sub-id "<SUB_ID>" --concurrency 2 --retries 5
```

In `note` mode, you can also enable PDF export and MinerU Markdown extraction for slide assets:

```bash
python "<SKILL_DIR>/scripts/look_tongji.py" note --lecture-url "<LECTURE_URL>" --to-pdf --scan-mode doc --mineru --mineru-pages "17-24"
```

Artifacts are written to `./tongji-output/` under your current working directory.

## Agent Note

When a user says `look-tongji:setup` / `look-tongji:list` / `look-tongji:note`, follow `SKILL.md` and run the matching CLI commands in `scripts/look_tongji.py`.
For `look-tongji:note`, default to running transcript + slide download in parallel; only skip slide download when the user explicitly asks not to download slides/PPT.
When writing notes, use both transcript output and slide images by default.
If the user provides a course name, prefer `list --all --query ...` to avoid missing courses that are not in the recent list.

## Notice / Compliance

> [!CAUTION]
> It is strongly recommended to set your Tongji account/password via the CLI (`setup`) before asking the agent to generate notes. Do not paste passwords into chat.

> [!NOTE]
> - Inspiration and parts of the code are from: [Fudan_iCourse_Subscriber](https://github.com/LeafCreeper/Fudan_iCourse_Subscriber)
> - This project is intended for **personal learning and review** only, and for technical communication. It does not save full video files by default.
> - Users must comply with the relevant platform rules and school policies. Any misuse (including re-distribution of copyrighted course videos/audios) is the user's responsibility.
> - When logging in outside the campus network (or without Tongji VPN), enhanced authentication may be triggered. Keep this in mind if you run the agent remotely.

## ToDo

- [ ] Build a course dashboard frontend (videos, timeline, subtitles, notes).
- [ ] Support login flows with enhanced authentication.
- [ ] Add course-level LLM wiki + notes database for review workflows.
- [ ] Build a standalone TUI/GUI tool for manual transcription/notes/Q&A.

## Best practices

- Generate subtitles + notes for the latest lecture:
  - `/look-tongji-notes help me generate subtitles and notes for the latest lecture`
  
- Generate subtitles + notes for a named course:
  - `/look-tongji-notes help me generate subtitles and notes for today's Advanced Mathematics lecture`
  
- List recent courses and let the user choose:
  - `/look-tongji-notes list recent courses and let me choose one to process`
  
- If the agent cannot find the course:

  Use `list --all --query "<keyword>"` to search the full course list, or open the platform and copy the lecture URL.

  then say: ``/look-tongji-notes here is the link，generate note``
